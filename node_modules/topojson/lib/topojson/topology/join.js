// Given an extracted (pre-)topology, identifies all of the junctions. These are
// the points at which arcs (lines or rings) will need to be cut so that each
// arc is represented uniquely.
//
// A junction is a point where at least one arc deviates from another arc going
// through the same point. For example, consider the point B. If there is a arc
// through ABC and another arc through CBA, then B is not a junction because in
// both cases the adjacent point pairs are {A,C}. However, if there is an
// additional arc ABD, then {A,D} != {A,C}, and thus B becomes a junction.
//
// For a closed ring ABCA, the first point Aâ€™s adjacent points are the second
// and last point {B,C}. For a line, the first and last point are always
// considered junctions, even if the line is closed; this ensures that a closed
// line is never rotated.
